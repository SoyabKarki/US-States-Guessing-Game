# US States Guessing Game

A simple trivia game made using the turtle GUI and pandas module. 

# How to play

Run the main.py file. 
Enter the name of a state in the dialog box. 
If the name is correctly typed in, a score of 1 will be added. Total score can be seen on the title of the dialog box. 
There are two ways to end the game - correctly enter all the 50 states, or type 'Exit' on the text entry.
The names of the states that were missed and/ or guessed incorrectly are stored on the 'States_to_learn.csv' file.
